# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to design and implement an automated Network Operations Center (NOC) solution using AWS cloud services. The solution continuously monitors an Amazon EC2 instance running the Apache (httpd) web server. When the Apache service stops unexpectedly, the system automatically detects the issue, restarts the service using AWS Systems Manager, and sends an email notification to the operations team through Amazon SNS.

The project demonstrates how AWS managed services can be integrated to reduce manual operational tasks, improve service availability, and automate incident response.

---

## 1.2 Business Background

Modern organizations rely on web servers to deliver business applications and services. If a web server becomes unavailable due to a service failure, users may experience downtime, resulting in reduced productivity and poor customer experience.

Traditionally, operations engineers monitor servers manually or respond only after receiving incident reports. This approach increases recovery time and operational effort.

An automated monitoring and remediation solution helps organizations detect failures immediately, restore services automatically, and notify engineers without requiring manual intervention.

---

## 1.3 Problem Statement

The existing environment does not provide automated monitoring or recovery for critical services running on the EC2 instance.

As a result:

- Service failures may go unnoticed.
- Engineers must manually connect to the server.
- Recovery time increases.
- Service availability decreases.
- Manual operations consume valuable time.

The organization requires an automated solution that detects service failures, restores services automatically, and informs the operations team immediately.

---

# 2. Business Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Monitor the Apache (httpd) service continuously.
- Detect service failures automatically.
- Restart the Apache service without manual intervention.
- Notify the operations team after successful remediation.
- Reduce service downtime.
- Improve system availability.
- Reduce operational effort.
- Demonstrate AWS automation using managed services.

- CloudWatch Agent is installed and configured.
- Systems Manager Agent is installed and running.
- IAM role with the required inline policy is attached to the EC2 instance.
- Internet connectivity is available.
- Email subscription for Amazon SNS is confirmed.

---

# 9. Constraints

The following constraints apply to this project:

- Single AWS Region (Asia Pacific – Mumbai).
- Single EC2 instance.
- Apache (httpd) is the only monitored application.
- Email notification is the only notification method.
- Infrastructure is deployed manually.

---

# 10. Business Benefits

The implemented solution provides the following benefits:

- Faster detection of application failures.
- Automatic service recovery.
- Reduced operational effort.
- Lower Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR).
- Improved server availability.
- Better monitoring visibility.
- Centralized monitoring dashboard.
- Practical implementation of AWS automation.

---

# 11. Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Incorrect IAM permissions | Validate IAM inline policies before deployment. |
| CloudWatch Agent failure | Monitor the CloudWatch Agent service regularly. |
| Lambda execution failure | Review Lambda logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. |
| SSM Agent failure | Verify that the SSM Agent is running and registered. |
| Alarm misconfiguration | Test alarms before production deployment. |

---

# 12. Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:

- The CloudWatch Agent publishes metrics successfully.
- CloudWatch detects Apache service failures.
- CloudWatch Alarm changes to the ALARM state.
